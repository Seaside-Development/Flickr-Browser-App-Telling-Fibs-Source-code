 Trying out Json and logging in features
 
 @todo
1. Try to build, run, and understand the app
2. Search and understand how various websites use REST web API
   (twitter, Facebook, Instagram…)
3. Design an app retrieving tasks info from your Flask web service, realize the core functions in sequence:
  • HTTP connection to get JSON data
  • Deserialize JSON data to object structure
  • Put object data to widgets for display
4. Design an app with basic login/register features (HTTP/REST/SQLite/MySQL)
5. Think about Gson, which maps JSON data to Java objects automatically
